Tech Task: Weekly Budget Control App

Objective:
Develop an application to help users control their weekly budget.

Requirements:
1. At the beginning of the week, prompt the user to enter their total weekly budget (positive number, in dollars). +
2. At the end of each day (7 days in total):
    - Prompt the user to input their daily expenses.
    - If the user enters an invalid input (non-numeric or empty), assume default daily expenses of 100$.
    - After entering daily expenses, show the user:
        - Total spent so far.
        - Remaining budget (weekly budget - total expenses).
3. At the end of the week (after 7 inputs):
    - Notify the user whether they stayed within the budget or exceeded it.
    - If exceeded, show by how much.
4. Validate user inputs where possible:
    - Expenses should be non-negative numbers (integers or floats with up to 2 decimal points).
5. No interruption if budget is exceeded during the week ‚Äî just notify at the end.

Assumptions:
- No need for persistent data storage ‚Äî the app works for a single session.
- User must interact via console/terminal.
